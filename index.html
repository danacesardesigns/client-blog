    <h3>~ You Have Cat to be Kitten Me! ~</h3>

<article class="KittenBio">
    <p>A nice warm laptop for me to sit on. Why use post when this sofa is here? So i is not fat, i is fluffy. Wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your hooman's bed and fall asleep again but eat the rubberband or it's 3am, time to create some chaos . When plates are clanked together signalling the arrival of cat food. I can haz carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle yet sleeping in the box. That box? i can fit in that box. Climb leg, but purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr stare at imaginary bug jump on counter removed by hooman jump on counter again removed by hooman meow before jumping on counter this time to let the hooman know am coming back. Climb leg cat is love, cat is life purr when being pet yet tweeting a baseball ptracy, for fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Lie on your belly and purr freak hooman out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now</p>

<article class="HigginsBio">
    <p>Slap hooman's face at 4am until hooman fills food dish. Time to go zooooom! I bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo. Hooman is in bath tub, emergency! drowning! meooowww! meow to be let out! Eats hooman's hair then claws head. Sleep. Push water glass on the floor meowing chowing and wowing. Leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers. Annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i lose. Lick the plastic bag snob you for another person. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff behind the couch, or oooo! dangly balls! jump swat swing flies so sweetly to the floor crash move on. Do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. I weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed so always hungry. Just going to dip my paw in your coffee and do a taste test - oh never mind i forgot i don't like coffee</p>
